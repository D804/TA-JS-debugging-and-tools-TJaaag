#### Write your implementation of testing framework and assertion. Only after completing this go forward.
testing framework can be used to test errors and spped the workflow and existing code not break while we add codes .we use testing framework to execute all the test because once get error test stop and not move to next line so we can't test all code so we use testting framework to test all code.


#### Write two tests for the following functions using test framework assertion

#### Add two number

1. Write a function that takes two input `numA` and `numB` and returns the sum of both numbers.
function 
2. After writing the function write 5 tests for above function with different values
3. Throw an error when the arguments passed in not a number.
4. Make first test fail and see if you get the result of second test.
5. If not fix it using the test framework (try...catch) we learned in the testing framework video.

#### Multiply two numbers

1. Write a function that takes two input `numA` and `numB` and returns the multiplication of both numbers.
2. After writing the function write 5 tests for above function with different values
3. Throw an error when the arguments passed in not a number.
4. Make first test fail and see if you get the result of second test.
5. If not fix it using the test framework (try...catch) we learned in the testing framework video.
